# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  - I think comparison operators are self explanatory once they were defined.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  - These I understand well, too. But naming the operators well is probably one of the more important parts.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  - I understand how they work, the order they need to be in to work. I need to remember to add `end` to these statements.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  - The time estimate was close, though I found myself taking extra time on each piece trying to make the code tidy.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - I want to look at how to prompt for input in other ways aside from `gets` and how to store / refresh data multiple times in a program.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  - I want to try to build out a longer decision making .rb file, to be more like a game.
